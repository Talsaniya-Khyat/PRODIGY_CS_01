Caesar Cipher Python Program
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a simple encryption technique. It allows users to input a message and a shift value to encrypt or decrypt the message.

Features
Encrypt messages by shifting characters by a specified amount.
Decrypt messages by shifting characters back to their original positions.
